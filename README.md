Funny breakup program _V001
It can be executed in the Pycharm terminal (compiled into an executable file. exe and executed locally or on other computers): PyInstaller-One File-No Console-Add-Data "Break up. jpg; . "--add-data" fuck off. jpg; . "Break up 02.py

Effect (similar to the funny resignation program): After clicking the file, the "Break Up" window pops up. When the mouse moves to the "Disagree" button, the button will automatically move, so that the "Disagree" button cannot be clicked. If you drop it directly, the "Only Agree to Close the Window" window will pop up, and you can only click "Agree".
After clicking "Agree", a new window will pop up showing "You don't deserve such a good person as my sister", and there is only a button of "I agree"; Click "I agree" and display the picture of "Fuck off. jpg" before exiting the program.
